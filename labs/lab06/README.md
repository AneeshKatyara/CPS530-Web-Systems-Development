## Lab 06 – Creating Vector Images with SVG

This lab focuses on creating scalable vector graphics (SVG) using manually written SVG code.
The webpage contains solutions to two problems implemented entirely with SVG elements embedded in a single HTML page.

Problem 1 reproduces a set of geometric shapes using basic SVG primitives such as circles, polygons, polylines, and paths, with exact colour matching.
Problem 2 recreates a stylized text-based graphic using SVG text and curved paths, including custom fonts, letter spacing, and a curved line between the first and last name.

The lab emphasizes precise positioning using coordinates, clean and readable SVG markup, and avoiding the use of automatic SVG generators.
