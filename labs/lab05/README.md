## Lab 05 – Advanced JavaScript and jQuery

This lab focuses on client-side programming using JavaScript and jQuery to dynamically manipulate the DOM without reloading the page.
The webpage implements three interactive features: a form with input validation and formatted output, a real-time digital clock displayed on the screen, and an interactive image that enlarges on click and can be restored using a control button.

The lab emphasizes event handling, regular expressions, DOM manipulation, real-time updates using JavaScript timers, and basic jQuery-based interactions.
