# Lab 07 – CGI and Perl Programming

This lab explores server-side web development using Perl and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). The objective was to understand how Perl scripts interact with a web server to generate dynamic web pages, process user input from HTML forms, validate data using regular expressions, and handle file uploads.

The lab is divided into three parts, each demonstrating a different aspect of CGI-based server-side functionality.

## Lab Components

**Part A – Basic Perl CGI Script**  
Introduces a simple Perl CGI program that dynamically generates HTML content and confirms correct server-side execution.

**Part B – Form Processing and Validation**  
Implements a Bed & Breakfast reservation form using HTML and a Perl CGI script. User input is validated on the server using regular expressions for fields such as postal code, phone number, and email address, with appropriate error handling and confirmation output.

**Part C – File Upload Handling**  
Demonstrates handling multipart form data by allowing users to upload an image and submit text. The CGI script processes the input, saves the uploaded file on the server, and dynamically displays the submitted content.
