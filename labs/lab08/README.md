# Lab 08 – PHP Server-Side Programming

This lab focuses on server-side web development using PHP. The objective was to understand how PHP can be embedded within HTML to create dynamic web pages that respond to system conditions, user input, and stored cookies.

The lab demonstrates conditional logic, form handling, dynamic table generation, and the use of cookies to preserve user preferences across sessions.

## Lab Components

**Problem 1 – Time-Based Dynamic Content**  
Uses PHP to determine the current time of day and dynamically display a greeting message with a corresponding background image and text color.

**Problem 2 – Dynamic Table Generation**  
Implements a form that accepts user input for rows and columns and generates a multiplication table dynamically. Server-side validation ensures numeric input within a valid range.

**Problem 3 – Cookies and User Preferences**  
Allows users to select a favourite image, which is stored using cookies. The selected preference is retrieved and displayed on subsequent visits.
