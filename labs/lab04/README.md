## Lab 04 – Client-Side Programming with JavaScript

This lab focuses on client-side programming using vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries.
The webpage implements two interactive features: a bookmark list that identifies secure and insecure URLs using padlock icons, and a palindrome checker that evaluates strings after normalizing their content.

The lab emphasizes DOM manipulation, string processing with regular expressions, and separating JavaScript logic into an external file.
