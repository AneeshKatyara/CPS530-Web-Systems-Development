<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Aneesh Katyara, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of
Science (Honours) in Computer Science Co-op at Toronto Metropolitan University with a
minor in Business. I have achieved a CGPA of 3.5/4.33 and earned a place on the Dean's
List in recognition of my academic excellence. Alongside my studies, I am passionate
about exploring how technology, business, and people connect. I enjoy solving
problems, building innovative solutions, and creating positive impact through my
professional roles, leadership positions, and volunteer involvement.</p>
<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
<p>I have always been curious about how technology works — from apps we use every
day to the systems that keep everything running. Computer Science gives me the chance
to dig into that curiosity, learn how things are built, and even create solutions of
my own. For me, it's like solving puzzles while shaping ideas into something real and
useful.</p>
